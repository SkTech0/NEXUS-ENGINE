# Enterprise Readiness Report

## Purpose

Report on NEXUS-ENGINE enterprise readiness: readiness for enterprise and regulated/sovereign adoption (tiers, support, SLA, data residency, compliance, distribution). Additive; no change to engine behavior. Report is a template; content and status are org-specific.

## Readiness Areas

| Area | Documentation | Scope | Status (template) |
|------|---------------|--------|--------------------|
| **Tiers** | tiers/enterprise, regulated, sovereign | Enterprise, regulated, sovereign editions | Defined; implementation org-specific |
| **Support** | operations/support-tiers | Dedicated, 24/7, compliance-aware | Defined; staffing and tooling org-specific |
| **SLA** | operations/sla-tiers | 99.9%+, contractual remedies | Defined; measurement and reporting org-specific |
| **Data residency** | tiers/enterprise, regulated, sovereign; distribution/sovereign-cloud | Region/country commitment | Defined; deployment and contract org-specific |
| **Compliance** | engine-certification-layer; tiers/regulated, sovereign | Audit, compliance evidence, regulated distribution | Defined; evidence and accreditation org-specific |
| **Distribution** | distribution/on-prem, air-gapped, sovereign-cloud | On-prem, air-gapped, sovereign cloud | Defined; delivery org-specific |
| **Licensing** | licensing/enterprise | Enterprise license | Defined; terms org-specific |
| **Commercial** | commercial/contract-enforcement, entitlements, license-validation | Contract, entitlement, license | Defined; implementation org-specific |
| **Governance** | governance/ | Lifecycle, deprecation, compatibility | Defined; process org-specific |

## Evidence

- EPL defines enterprise, regulated, and sovereign tiers and distribution; implementation (support, SLA, data residency, compliance, delivery) is org-specific.
- engine-certification-layer (compliance, audit, legal, safety) feeds into enterprise and regulated readiness.
- Engine remains unchanged; enterprise readiness is tier, operations, distribution, and commercial ops.

## Gaps and Next Steps (template)

| Gap | Area | Next step |
|-----|------|-----------|
| Support | operations/support-tiers | Staff and tooling for dedicated/24/7 support |
| SLA | operations/sla-tiers | Implement SLA measurement and credit process |
| Data residency | tiers/enterprise; distribution/sovereign-cloud | Deploy in regions; contractual commitment |
| Compliance | engine-certification-layer; tiers/regulated | Evidence pipeline; accreditation |
| Air-gapped | distribution/air-gapped | Signed, air-gapped package and delivery |
| (Org-specific) | — | — |

## Status

- Enterprise readiness report template in place; status and gaps are org-specific.
- No engine regression.
