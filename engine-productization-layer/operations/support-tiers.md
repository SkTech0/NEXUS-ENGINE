# Support Tiers

## Purpose

Define support tiers for NEXUS-ENGINE: levels of support (community, email, ticket, dedicated, 24/7) that correspond to product tiers and commercial agreements. Additive; no change to engine behavior or APIs.

## Principles

- **Tier-based support**: Support level is tied to product tier (tiers/; api-product/api-tiers); higher tier = higher support.
- **Operational only**: Support is process and staffing; no engine logic change.
- **SLA alignment**: Support tier may align with SLA tier (operations/sla-tiers); response time and resolution targets per tier.

## Support Tier Levels

| Tier | Channel | Response (typical) | Scope |
|------|---------|-------------------|-------|
| **Community** | Forums, docs | Best-effort | Community tier |
| **Developer** | Docs, community; optional email | Best-effort or N business hours | Developer tier |
| **Professional** | Email, ticket; business or 24/5 | N hours (e.g., 24h) | Professional tier |
| **Enterprise** | Dedicated or named; 24/7 optional | Contractual (e.g., 4h critical) | Enterprise tier |
| **Regulated / sovereign** | Dedicated; compliance-aware | Contractual | Regulated, sovereign tier |

## Support Scope

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Scope** | Engine usage, API, SDK, deployment, config; not custom development |
| **Exclusions** | Custom code, third-party issues; per contract |
| **Escalation** | L1/L2/L3 or equivalent; org-specific |
| **Customer success** | Optional onboarding, adoption (operations/customer-success) |
| **Tooling** | Ticket system, knowledge base, status page (operations/ops-tooling) |

## Commercial Alignment

- Support tier is part of plan and entitlement (commercial/entitlements; api-product/api-plans).
- Billing may include support (monetization/subscription); contract enforcement (commercial/contract-enforcement).
- No engine logic or API changes; support tiers are operations only.

## Certification Readiness

- Support tiers documented; response times and channels are org-specific.
- No engine regression.
