# Marketplace Ecosystem

## Purpose

Define the marketplace ecosystem for NEXUS-ENGINE: catalog of first-party and third-party offerings (plugins, connectors, extensions, solutions) that customers can discover and use with the engine. Additive; no change to engine behavior or API contracts.

## Principles

- **Catalog and distribution**: Marketplace = catalog (listings, metadata, ratings) and optional distribution (download, subscribe); engine is unchanged.
- **Ecosystem growth**: Marketplace drives adoption of plugins, connectors, extensions (ecosystem/plugin-ecosystem, connector-ecosystem, extension-ecosystem); revenue share or listing fee is org-specific.
- **Governance**: Listings may be certified or community; compatibility and security review (governance/compatibility-policy); no engine logic change.

## Marketplace Scope

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Listings** | Plugins, connectors, extensions, solution templates; metadata, docs, version |
| **Certification** | Certified vs community; review process (org-specific) |
| **Distribution** | Download, install, or subscribe; license per listing |
| **Revenue** | Listing fee, revenue share, or free (org-specific) |
| **Tier** | Marketplace access per tier (e.g., Professional+ for certified) (tiers/) |

## Platform Alignment

- Marketplace is part of engine-as-a-platform (offerings/engine-as-a-platform); SDK and connector ecosystems feed listings (ecosystem/sdk-ecosystem, connector-ecosystem).
- Cloud marketplaces (distribution/cloud-marketplaces) are distribution channel for engine; this marketplace is for ecosystem add-ons.
- No engine logic or API changes; marketplace is product and catalog only.

## Certification Readiness

- Marketplace ecosystem documented; catalog and certification are org-specific.
- No engine regression.
