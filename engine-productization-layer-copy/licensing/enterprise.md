# Enterprise License

## Purpose

Define the enterprise license model for NEXUS-ENGINE: use under an enterprise agreement for large organizations with custom terms, volume, support, and compliance. Additive; no change to engine behavior or APIs.

## Principles

- **Enterprise agreement**: Contract governs use, scope, support, SLA, data residency, and compliance; license is part of agreement.
- **Volume and scope**: Unlimited or high-volume use; multiple deployments, regions, or business units per contract.
- **No engine logic change**: Licensing is legal and commercial policy; engine code and API unchanged.

## License Characteristics

| Aspect | Enterprise typical |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Use** | Production; organization-wide; multiple deployments/regions per contract |
| **Scope** | Unlimited or high volume; nodes, users, or usage per agreement |
| **Support** | Dedicated or named support; 24/7 optional (operations/support-tiers) |
| **SLA** | 99.9% or higher; financial remedies (operations/sla-tiers) |
| **Data residency** | Contractual region/country commitment (tiers/enterprise) |
| **Compliance** | Audit, compliance evidence (engine-certification-layer); regulated/sovereign options (tiers/regulated, sovereign) |
| **Term** | Multi-year typical; renewal and price protection per contract |

## Tier and Offering Alignment

- **Enterprise tier**: Enterprise license (tiers/enterprise).
- **Regulated / sovereign**: Enterprise or sovereign license (tiers/regulated, sovereign; licensing/sovereign if defined).
- **EaaS, runtime, library, platform**: All may be covered under enterprise agreement (offerings/).
- No engine logic or API changes; enterprise license is legal and commercial only.

## Commercial Alignment

- Contract enforcement, entitlements, license validation (commercial/contract-enforcement, entitlements, license-validation).
- Billing may be annual or capacity-based (commercial/billing; monetization/capacity-based).
- No engine regression.

## Certification Readiness

- Enterprise license model documented; terms and negotiation are org-specific.
- No engine regression.
