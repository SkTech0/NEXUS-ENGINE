# Nexus Fraud Engine — Roadmap

---

## Intent

This roadmap is **product-level**: themes and direction, not commitments or dates. It defines how the product can evolve while staying within its identity (RiskTech product for fraud detection and prevention).

---

## Theme 1: Core risk experience

- Stable flag/block/review with clear explanations.  
- Operator-facing score, flags, and reason.  
- Risk team-facing audit and explanation view.  

---

## Theme 2: Risk team control and policy

- Product-level threshold and action configuration.  
- Rules, thresholds, and referral behavior (no code for common changes).  
- Override and referral flow with audit trail.  

---

## Theme 3: Compliance and explainability

- Audit trail for every assessment and override.  
- Regulator- and auditor-friendly export or review.  
- Consistency with investigation and compliance norms.  

---

## Theme 4: Embedded and partner readiness

- Clear integration contract for payment, onboarding, and ops.  
- Embedded risk in payment, GovTech, and SaaS flows.  
- Partner-specific scenarios and documentation.  

---

## Theme 5: Segment and product expansion (only if in scope)

- Identity fraud or benefits fraud framing (product decision).  
- Abuse or account takeover framing.  
- Any expansion stays within “fraud/risk decision product.”  

---

## Out of roadmap (by design)

- Core engine implementation (platform).  
- Generic infra, security, billing (platform).  
- Loan or hiring domain (other products).  
- Full payment or core banking (external systems).
