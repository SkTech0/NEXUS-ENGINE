# Nexus Fraud Engine

**RiskTech product for fraud detection & prevention.**

---

## What is Nexus Fraud Engine?

Nexus Fraud Engine is a **product** that delivers automated, explainable fraud detection and prevention for FinTech, GovTech, and SaaS. It is the user-facing value layer for risk: transactions and entities get risk scores and flags; operators get reasons and control.

## Who is it for?

- **FinTech** detecting payment, account, or identity fraud  
- **GovTech** detecting benefits fraud, identity abuse, or compliance risk  
- **SaaS** detecting abuse, fake accounts, or misuse  

## What problem does it solve?

- “How do we decide which transactions or entities are high risk—and why?”  
- “How do we scale fraud detection without losing explainability or control?”  
- “How do we give operators and auditors clear, actionable reasons?”  

## Why it exists

Fraud Engine exists to **turn decision intelligence into risk outcomes**. It owns the fraud/risk *product* experience: transaction or entity → risk assessment → score/flags → explanation → (optional) action. The platform provides engines and infra; Fraud Engine provides the product story and domain scope.

## Value

- **Speed**: Risk assessment in real time or near real time.  
- **Consistency**: Same rules and models applied every time.  
- **Explainability**: “Why flagged” for operators and regulators.  
- **Control**: Risk teams configure thresholds and actions within the product.  

## What belongs here (product scope)

- Fraud/risk assessment flow and decision experience  
- Risk-specific policies, thresholds, and action framing  
- Product narrative for risk teams and operators  
- Roadmap and scope for fraud/risk features  

## What does NOT belong here

- Core decision engine implementation (platform)  
- Generic infra, APIs, or security (platform)  
- Loan or hiring domain logic (other products)  
- Playground demo content (Playground product)
