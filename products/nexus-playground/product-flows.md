# Nexus Playground — Product Flows

---

## Primary flows

### 1. First-time visitor (investor / client)

1. Land on Playground entry.  
2. See value proposition and “what you can do here.”  
3. Choose a path: e.g., Loan demo, Hiring demo, Fraud demo, or “Platform overview.”  
4. Follow guided scenario with sample inputs.  
5. See decision output, explanation, and optional trust/optimization views.  
6. Exit with clear takeaway: “This is what Nexus does.”  

### 2. Engineer exploring capabilities

1. Enter Playground (no production access required).  
2. Select capability area (e.g., decision API, explainability, optimization).  
3. Run sample requests or use minimal UI to trigger flows.  
4. Inspect responses, structure, and behavior.  
5. Use learnings to plan integration or POC.  

### 3. Sales / demo presenter

1. Open predefined demo script or flow.  
2. Walk through scenario with prospect (e.g., loan application → decision → explanation).  
3. Show optional deep-dives (trust scores, optimization, graphs).  
4. Conclude with product handoff (e.g., “This becomes Nexus Loan Engine in production”).  

### 4. Cross-product exploration

1. User runs a loan scenario in Playground.  
2. Optionally run a comparable hiring or fraud scenario.  
3. Compare “how the platform behaves” across domains.  
4. Understand shared platform value (decision intelligence) vs. product-specific value.  

## Flow principles

- **Linear optional**: Guided paths exist, but free exploration is allowed.  
- **No persistence of real data**: Only demo/sample data; no long-term storage of sensitive inputs.  
- **Clear exit points**: Every flow can end with “Try a product” or “Contact us” without confusion.

*Flows describe how users interact with the product. They are independent of technical APIs or UI components.*
