# Nexus Playground — Demo Scenarios

---

## Purpose

Demo scenarios are **curated product experiences** that show decision intelligence in action. Each scenario is self-contained, uses sample data, and supports the Playground narrative.

## Loan-oriented scenario

- **Story**: “A customer applies for a loan; Nexus evaluates and explains the decision.”  
- **Inputs**: Sample applicant profile (income, history, purpose—all synthetic).  
- **Outputs**: Decision (e.g., approve/decline/refer), reasoning, optional trust/confidence.  
- **Demo angle**: Highlights Nexus Loan Engine value without production.

## Platform overview scenario

- **Name**: “What is Nexus?”  
- **Story**: High-level walkthrough of decision intelligence: input → reasoning → decision → explanation.

- **Demo angle**: For investors or first-time visitors who need the big picture.

## Scenario principles

- **No real data**: All scenarios use synthetic or anonymized sample data.  
- **Repeatable**: Same inputs yield consistent narrative; no dependency on live production.  
- **Extensible**: New scenarios (e.g., new product teasers) can be added as product scope evolves.

*Demo scenarios define the “what we show.” Implementation (which engine, which API) follows product and platform boundaries.*
