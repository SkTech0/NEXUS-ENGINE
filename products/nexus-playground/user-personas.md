# Nexus Playground — User Personas

---

## 1. The investor

- **Goal**: Assess whether Nexus is a credible, product-ready investment.  
- **Needs**: See working demos, understand market fit, minimal technical depth.  
- **Behavior**: Short session, narrative-driven, “show me the product.”  
- **Success**: Leaves with a clear story: what Nexus does and why it matters.  

## 2. The enterprise client (evaluator)

- **Goal**: Decide if Nexus fits their use case (e.g., lending, hiring, fraud).  
- **Needs**: Relevant scenarios (loan/hiring/fraud), transparent decisions, sense of control.  
- **Behavior**: Tries 1–2 scenarios, may ask “what if we change this input?”  
- **Success**: Can articulate how Nexus would apply to their organization.  

## 3. The engineer (integrator)

- **Goal**: Understand capabilities and behavior before building integration.  
- **Needs**: Clear inputs/outputs, explanation of decision structure, no production dependency.  
- **Behavior**: Runs multiple scenarios, inspects responses, may compare to docs.  
- **Success**: Has enough context to design or implement a POC.  

## 4. The demo presenter (internal / sales)

- **Goal**: Run a repeatable, impressive demo for prospects.  
- **Needs**: Reliable flows, minimal clicks, optional deep-dive points.  
- **Behavior**: Follows script, adapts to questions, stays in Playground.  
- **Success**: Demo completes without errors and supports the sales narrative.  

## 5. The explorer (technical stakeholder)

- **Goal**: See what “decision intelligence” means in practice.  
- **Needs**: Low friction, multiple domains (loan, hiring, fraud), optional depth.  
- **Behavior**: Browsing, trying different scenarios, comparing outcomes.  
- **Success**: Builds a mental model of platform + products.

*Personas define who the product serves. They inform flows, content, and prioritization—not implementation details.*
