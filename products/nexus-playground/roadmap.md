# Nexus Playground — Roadmap

---

## Intent

This roadmap is **product-level**: themes and direction, not commitments or dates. It defines how the product can evolve while staying within its identity (demo & exploration).

---

## Theme 1: Narrative and first impression

- Sharpen entry experience and value proposition.  
- Align demo narrative with “Platform → Products” story.  
- Optional: investor-focused path (minimal steps, maximum clarity).  

---

## Theme 2: Scenario coverage

- Ensure loan, hiring, and fraud demo scenarios are stable and representative.  
- Add or refine “what if” exploration (e.g., change one input, see outcome).  
- Optional: scenario templates that mirror real product flows.  

---

## Theme 3: Audience fit

- Engineer path: clearer mapping from Playground to API/docs and POC.  
- Client path: clearer handoff to “try the real product” or “talk to sales.”  
- Presenter path: scripted flows and talking points for demos.  

---

## Theme 4: Consistency and quality

- Demo stability (no surprise failures during key meetings).  
- Sample data and scenarios kept in sync with product positioning.  
- Optional: lightweight feedback or “was this useful?” to inform prioritization.  

---

## Theme 5: Future expansion (only if in scope)

- Optional: export or share link for a specific demo state (product decision).  
- Optional: short “report” view for investors (one-pager of what was shown).  
- Any new capability must stay within “demo & exploration”; no production features.  

---

## Out of roadmap (by design)

- Production decision processing.  
- Real customer data or live system integration.  
- Billing, entitlements, or tenant management.  
- Implementation of core engines (platform responsibility).
