# Nexus Hiring Engine — Roadmap

---

## Intent

This roadmap is **product-level**: themes and direction, not commitments or dates. It defines how the product can evolve while staying within its identity (HRTech decision product for hiring decisions).

---

## Theme 1: Core recommendation experience

- Stable shortlist/interview/hire (and refer) with clear explanations.  
- Hiring manager-facing reason and optional comparison view.  
- Candidate-facing outcome and (where in scope) feedback.  

---

## Theme 2: HR control and criteria

- Product-level criteria and referral configuration.  
- Role-specific thresholds and rules (no code for common changes).  
- Override and referral flow with audit trail.  

---

## Theme 3: Fairness and compliance

- Audit trail for every recommendation and override.  
- Auditor- and compliance-friendly export or review.  
- Consistency with fairness and bias-review norms.  

---

## Theme 4: ATS and HR integration

- Clear integration contract for ATS and HR systems.  
- Embedded hiring flows (e.g., screening inside ATS).  
- Partner-specific scenarios and documentation.  

---

## Theme 5: Segment and product expansion (only if in scope)

- Skills-based or diversity-aware evaluation (product decision).  
- Volume hiring or campus hiring framing.  
- Any expansion stays within “hiring decision product.”  

---

## Out of roadmap (by design)

- Core engine implementation (platform).  
- Generic infra, security, billing (platform).  
- Loan or fraud domain (other products).  
- Full ATS or HRIS (external systems).
