# ISO 27001 Alignment

## Purpose

Align NEXUS-ENGINE with ISO/IEC 27001 (information security management systems) for enterprise procurement and regulated deployments. Additive; no change to engine behavior.

## Scope

- Information security management system (ISMS) alignment
- Risk assessment and treatment applicable to engine assets
- Controls relevant to engine processing, storage, and transmission of information
- Documentation and evidence for certification audits

## Alignment Areas

| Control Area | Engine Relevance | Readiness |
|--------------|------------------|-----------|
| A.5 Organizational controls | Policies, roles, segregation of duties for engine operations | Documented |
| A.6 People controls | Access, training, disciplinary for engine operators | Documented |
| A.8 Technological controls | Access control, cryptography, logging, resilience | Documented |
| Risk assessment | Engine data classification, threat model, treatment plan | Documented |
| Statement of applicability | Engine-specific controls and justification | Documented |

## Engine-Specific Controls

- **Access control**: Engine APIs and admin interfaces covered by IAM/RBAC (see enterprise).
- **Cryptography**: Secrets, keys, and sensitive data at rest/transit (see secrets, data protection).
- **Logging and monitoring**: Immutable audit logs, traceability (see audit).
- **Resilience**: Failure isolation, recovery, DR (see engine-resilience-layer).
- **Supplier relationships**: Engine as product; supplier security requirements documented.

## Evidence and Documentation

- Risk assessment covering engine assets and processing.
- Control implementation statements for engine-relevant ISO 27001 controls.
- Procedures for change management, incident response, and business continuity as they apply to the engine.
- Internal audit and management review evidence.

## Certification Readiness

- Alignment documented; formal certification requires organization-level ISMS and external audit.
- Engine design supports control objectives; no engine logic or API changes required.
