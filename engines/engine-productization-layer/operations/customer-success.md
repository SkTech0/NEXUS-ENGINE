# Customer Success

## Purpose

Define customer success for NEXUS-ENGINE: onboarding, adoption, health monitoring, and renewal support for customers (typically enterprise and high-touch tiers). Additive; no change to engine behavior or APIs.

## Principles

- **Adoption and retention**: Customer success drives successful deployment, usage, and renewal; not engine logic change.
- **Tier-based**: Customer success typically for professional, enterprise, regulated (tiers/); scope and touch per tier.
- **Operational only**: Processes, tooling, and staffing; engine code and API unchanged.

## Customer Success Scope

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Onboarding** | Kickoff, environment setup, integration guidance; per tier |
| **Adoption** | Usage guidance, best practices, use-case alignment |
| **Health** | Usage and health monitoring; proactive outreach (operations/ops-tooling) |
| **Renewal** | Renewal process, expansion, feedback; commercial alignment (commercial/contract-enforcement) |
| **Escalation** | Escalation to support or product; org-specific |
| **Tooling** | CRM, health dashboards, usage reports (operations/ops-tooling) |

## Tier Alignment

| Tier | Customer success typical |
|------|---------------------------|
| Community / developer | Self-serve; docs and community |
| Professional | Optional onboarding; email check-ins |
| Enterprise | Dedicated or named CSM; health reviews; renewal support |
| Regulated / sovereign | Compliance-aware; dedicated touch |

## Commercial Alignment

- Customer success supports retention and expansion; entitlements and contract (commercial/entitlements, contract-enforcement).
- No engine logic or API changes; customer success is operations only.

## Certification Readiness

- Customer success documented; scope and tooling are org-specific.
- No engine regression.
