## 1. Value Proposition

### 1.1 For Customers

- **Single platform** for distributed systems, data, intelligence, optimization, AI, and trust — less integration and operational overhead.
- **Built-in SaaS and monetization**: Multi-tenant, auth, RBAC, subscription, billing, usage tracking, pricing, payments, invoices — faster time-to-revenue.
- **Enterprise-ready**: Compliance, governance, SLA, policy, and audit — suitable for regulated and large accounts.

### 1.2 For Ecosystem

- **Platform and marketplace**: Plugins, integrations, and extensions (plugin_engine, integration_engine, marketplace_engine, extension_framework) — third parties can build and monetize on top.
- **API and registry**: Clear API surface and API registry — discoverability and versioning.
