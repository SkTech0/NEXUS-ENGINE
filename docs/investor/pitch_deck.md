## Slide 1: Title

**Nexus Engine**  
*Unified Platform for Distributed Intelligence, Trust & Monetization*

Tagline (one line).  
Date / version.

## Slide 2: Problem

- Enterprises need **distributed systems**, **AI/ML**, **trust**, and **monetization** in one stack.
- Point solutions create integration debt, compliance gaps, and fragmented billing.
- **Pain**: Multiple vendors, custom glue, delayed time-to-revenue.

---

## Slide 3: Solution

- **Nexus Engine**: Single platform — engines (distributed, data, intelligence, optimization, AI, trust), API, product UI, SaaS layer, monetization, enterprise.
- **Outcome**: Faster build, built-in multi-tenant SaaS, usage-based billing, compliance and governance hooks.
- **Differentiator**: Clean architecture, DDD, modular engines; API + UI + backend in one repo.

## Slide 4: Product Overview

- **Engines**: Core, distributed (consensus, clocks, replication), data (models, storage, pipelines), intelligence (reasoning, inference, decision), optimization, AI (models, training, inference), trust (identity, reputation, verification).
- **API**: .NET 10 gateway; controllers for Engine, Intelligence, Optimization, AI, Trust.
- **Product UI**: Angular 18; dashboard, engine monitor, AI console, graph viewer, optimization.
- **SaaS & Monetization**: Multi-tenant, auth, RBAC, subscription, billing hooks, usage tracking, pricing, payments, invoices, revenue tracking.
- **Platform & Enterprise**: Plugins, integrations, marketplace, API registry, extensions; compliance, governance, SLA, policy.
