**FinTech decision product for automated loan decisions.**

---

## What is Nexus Loan Engine?

Nexus Loan Engine is a **product** that delivers automated, explainable loan decisioning for banks, NBFCs, and FinTechs. It is the user-facing value layer for lending: applicants get decisions; lenders get consistency, speed, and reasoning.

## Who is it for?

- **Banks** automating or augmenting credit decisions  
- **NBFCs** scaling underwriting without proportional headcount  
- **FinTechs** embedding loan decisioning into their apps and flows  

## What problem does it solve?

- “How do we decide who gets a loan, at what terms, and why?”  
- “How do we scale decisions without losing explainability or control?”  
- “How do we give applicants clear, fair outcomes and reasons?”  

## Why it exists

Loan Engine exists to **turn decision intelligence into lending outcomes**. It owns the lending *product* experience: application → decision → explanation → (optional) appeal or next steps. The platform provides engines and infra; Loan Engine provides the product story and domain scope.

## Value

- **Speed**: Automated decisions in seconds, not days.  
- **Consistency**: Same rules and models applied every time.  
- **Explainability**: “Why approved/declined” for applicants and regulators.  
- **Control**: Lenders configure policy and risk within the product.  

## What belongs here (product scope)

- Loan application flow and decision experience  
- Lending-specific policies, rules, and risk framing  
- Product narrative for lenders and applicants  
- Roadmap and scope for lending features  

## What does NOT belong here

- Core decision engine implementation (platform)  
- Generic infra, APIs, or security (platform)  
- Hiring or fraud domain logic (other products)  
- Playground demo content (Playground product)
