# Nexus Loan Engine — Roadmap

---

## Intent

This roadmap is **product-level**: themes and direction, not commitments or dates. It defines how the product can evolve while staying within its identity (FinTech decision product for loan decisions).

---

## Theme 1: Core decision experience

- Stable approve/decline/refer with clear explanations.  
- Applicant-facing reason in plain language.  
- Lender-facing audit and explanation view.  

---

## Theme 2: Lender control and policy

- Product-level policy and referral configuration.  
- Limits, rules, and referral thresholds (no code for common changes).  
- Override and referral flow with audit trail.  

---

## Theme 3: Compliance and explainability

- Audit trail for every decision and override.  
- Regulator- and auditor-friendly export or review.  
- Consistency with fairness and explainability norms.  

---

## Theme 4: Embedded and partner readiness

- Clear integration contract for origination and partners.  
- Embedded lending flows (e.g., checkout, payroll).  
- Partner-specific scenarios and documentation.  

---

## Theme 5: Segment and product expansion (only if in scope)

- SME or BNPL-specific flows (product decision).  
- Secured or specialty lending framing.  
- Any expansion stays within “loan decision product.”  

---

## Out of roadmap (by design)

- Core engine implementation (platform).  
- Generic infra, security, billing (platform).  
- Hiring or fraud domain (other products).  
- Full origination or servicing (external systems).
