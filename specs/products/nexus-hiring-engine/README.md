## Who is it for?

- **HR teams** scaling screening and shortlisting  
- **Enterprises** standardizing hiring decisions across teams  
- **Recruiters** getting consistent, explainable recommendations  

## What problem does it solve?

- “How do we scale hiring decisions without bias or inconsistency?”  
- “How do we give candidates and auditors clear, fair reasons?”  

## Why it exists

- Roadmap and scope for hiring features  

## What does NOT belong here
